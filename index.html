            <p>The goal of BlakJax is to capture five connecting squares horizontally, vertically or diagonally before
                your
                opponent can.</p>

            <p>The rules are almost just like <a href="http://www.pagat.com/misc/jack.html">One Eyed Jack</a> or
                Sequence. The
                difference is that there are no one or two eyed jacks. Instead red jacks are used to
                free up a square that has been captured by your opponent and black jacks are wild which means they can
                be used
                to
                capture any open square except for the jokers.</p>

            <p>The cards at the top are yours to play. When its your turn click of your cards to select it.
                The selected card will be highlighted in green. To capture a square click it when the matching card or a
                jack is
                selected. If the play is valid the cell will change to blue signifying that it has been captured by
                you.</p>

            <p>The last four cards that have been played are displayed below your cards. If you have a dead card,
                meaning all of
                the squares where it could have been played are already occupied, you can discard it and get a new one
                by
                clicking these cards.</p>
