        <p>The rules of BlakJax are almost just like Sequence but there are no one or two eyed jacks.  Instead red jacks are used to
            free up a square that has been captured by your opponent and black jacks are wild and can be played in any open square except for the corners.</p>
        <p>Your hand is located in the upper right section of the screen.  When its your turn to play click a card in your hand to select it.
            The selected card will be highlighted in green.  To capture a square click it when the matching card or a jack is selected in your haand.
            If the play is valid the cell will change to blue signifying that has been captured by you.</p>
        <p>If you capture five connecting squares horizontally, vertically or diagonally before the computer you win.  If not you lose.</p>
        <p>The cards at bottom show the last four cards that have been played.</p>
