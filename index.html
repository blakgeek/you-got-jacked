    <p>The goal of BlakJax is to capture five connecting squares horizontally, vertically or diagonally before your opponent can.</p>

    <p>The rules are almost just like <a href="http://www.pagat.com/misc/jack.html">One Eyed Jack</a> or Sequence. The
        difference is that there are no one or two eyed jacks. Instead red jacks are used to
        free up a square that has been captured by your opponent and black jacks are wild which means they can be used to
        capture any open square except for the jokers.</p>

    <p>The cards at the top are yours to play. When its your turn click of your cards to select it.
        The selected card will be highlighted in green. To capture a square click it when the matching card or a jack is
        selected.  If the play is valid the cell will change to blue signifying that it has been captured by you.</p>

    <p>The last four cards that have been played are displayed below your cards. If you have a dead card, meaning all of
        the squares where it could have been played are already occupied, you can discard it and get a new one by clicking these cards.</p>
