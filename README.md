# You Got Jacked

"You Got Jacked" is a card/board game based on [One Eyed Jack](http://www.pagat.com/misc/jack.html) and Sequence.

It is written in javascript along with html and a good helping of css3.

I did NOT use any super cool frameworks in the making of this game.  Mostly because I loath frameworks for making developers lazy and not in a good way.  I'm looking at you Angular.

I did however make liberal use of jQuery and Sass.  I freaking love jQuery.  And Sass is one sexy bitch.
